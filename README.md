# Proposal-Free Temporal Moment Localization

The repository includes:
* I3D features for Charades-STA.
* I3D features for ANET (released soon).
* Training and testing code
* Pre-trained weights for temporal moment localization in charades-sta.
* Evaluation

# Installation
## Requirements
We share a list of package used in our virtual enviroment in packagelist.txt, which can be used to create an identical environment with the following command

```
conda create --name myenv --file packageslist.txt
```

We are using pytorch 1.1.0 

## Download
Features used for Charades-STA can be downloaded from the following (link)[https://drive.google.com/open?id=16CNli3XE8B_Bsr3EzcRHu-VSI_juvv8t]

We train our model using pre-trained word vectors (glove.840B.300d.zip)[http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip]
